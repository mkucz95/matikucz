## Project Motivation
I am really excited about the various web technologies coming out, but the traditional combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript have dominated the industry for many years - and with good reason. Here I embark on a personal project of mine to create a website that showcases me better than a single page resume, and puts my skills to use! I decided to make a single page website (no re-loading the URL), and I also wanted to make it as fast as possible for users with slow connections. Next step is to make it mobile friendly - but the challenge is that I do not want to just simply make the display flexible, but rather will want to load a different version of the page.

## File Descriptions
- data.js: stores the information that will be loaded onto the website, as well as providing the interactive / single-page functionality.
- headshot.jpg: a picture of me that goes on the homepage
- index.html: the html file of the homepage.
- style.css: CSS file that controls the visuals of the page
- mstyle.css: experiment with mobile styling, not yet deployed.

## Interaction with Project:
