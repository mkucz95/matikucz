          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I am currently a student at UC San Diego in my fourth year. I am a passionate golfer and I am proud to be on the UCSD Men's Golf Team. I chose UC San Diego because of it's renowned academic caliber in the fields that interest me most - economics and computer science. The perfect weather and location, challenging intellectual environment, and demanding collegiate golf are all factors that have contributed to my progress and success as a student-athlete and person. I would like to work with businesses, investments, and technologies that deal with social and environmental causes around the world. It is a goal of mine to eventually utilize the languages I know throughout my career. <p>I enjoy cooking and all kinds of outdoor activities in my free time. As a California resident, I started to surf two years ago. I also enjoy tennis, basketball, volleyball, table tennis, hiking, or just being at the beach. I am also a passionate traveller and I hope to make it to three new places every year. South America and Africa are the next two continents I have set my sights on. San Diego, CA - is the 6th city in the 6th different country that I have lived in.</p>
